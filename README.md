Data Pipeline with AWS Glue and Athena

Overview::
This project demonstrates how to build a data pipeline using AWS Glue and Amazon Athena to efficiently process and query large datasets stored in Amazon S3. It automates the entire process of extracting data from an S3 bucket, transforming it using AWS Glue, and analyzing it using Athena. The results are then saved back into an output S3 bucket in CSV format.

The pipeline is managed with IAM (Identity and Access Management) to control access and permissions for various AWS services like S3, Glue, and Athena.

Architecture::
Amazon S3: Used for storing raw input data (CSV files) and processed output data.
AWS Glue: Used for automating the process of data cataloging and transformation.
Amazon Athena: Used for running SQL queries on the data stored in S3.
IAM: Provides secure access control, managing permissions for S3, Glue, and Athena.

Key Features::
Automated Data Ingestion: The project automatically fetches data from an S3 input bucket, processes it with Glue, and stores the processed results in an output S3 bucket.
SQL-Based Analytics: Using Athena, the project executes SQL queries directly on the data stored in S3 to perform analysis and aggregation.
IAM Integration: Managed project permissions using IAM, ensuring proper access control and security across S3, Glue, and Athena services.
Data Transformation: Glue is used to clean and transform the data into a structured format, making it ready for analysis.

Project steps::
1. Create S3 Buckets
Input Bucket: An S3 bucket is created to store raw CSV data.
Output Bucket: Another S3 bucket is created to store the processed results after running SQL queries in Athena.
2. Set Up AWS Glue
Create Database: A Glue database is created to organize data cataloging.
Table Crawling: A Glue table crawler is configured to automatically crawl the data from the input S3 bucket, catalog the structure, and make it ready for processing.
Schema Configuration: The correct schema is defined to ensure that the data is read and processed accurately by Glue.
3. Running Athena Queries
Athena Configuration: The output location (S3 bucket) is configured in Athena settings.
SQL Queries: SQL queries are executed in Amazon Athena to process the data (e.g., filtering, aggregation, joining), and the results are stored in the CSV format in the output S3 bucket.
4. IAM Role Management
IAM User: An IAM user is created with admin access to the services: S3, Glue, and Athena.
Permissions: IAM policies are applied to ensure the appropriate level of access and security across services. This ensures that the necessary services can interact seamlessly.

Technologies Used
AWS Athena: Serverless SQL queries on data stored in S3.
Amazon S3: Data storage for both input (raw data) and output (processed data).
AWS Glue: Data cataloging and transformation service.
IAM: Managing security and permissions for AWS resources.
SQL: Used in Athena for querying and transforming data.

Steps to Set Up
Create S3 Buckets:
Log into the AWS Management Console and create two S3 buckets: one for raw input data and another for storing processed output.
Set Up AWS Glue:
Create a Glue database.
Configure a Glue table crawler to automatically crawl the input data from the S3 bucket.
Define the schema of the input data to ensure correct data types and transformations.
Configure Athena:
Create a workgroup and configure the output location (output S3 bucket).
Run SQL queries in Athena to process the data from the input S3 bucket.
Ensure that the results are saved as CSV files in the output S3 bucket.
IAM Setup:
Create an IAM user with admin access to S3, Glue, and Athena.
Assign appropriate IAM policies to control permissions securely.
Run SQL Queries in Athena:
Perform data transformations (e.g., aggregation, joining) and execute the SQL queries.
View the results in the output S3 bucket in CSV format.

Athena SQL Query Example:
SELECT column1, column2, COUNT(*) FROM s3://input-bucket/data.csv GROUP BY column1, column2;



Conclusion
This project provides a fully automated data pipeline using AWS services, with a focus on scalability, automation, and cost-efficiency. By integrating AWS Glue, Athena, and IAM, the project demonstrates a seamless flow from raw data storage to transformed results stored back in S3, ready for analysis.
